# Pong_Python_project

It's a simple game.

press 'w' to move up, and 's' to move down.

To be able to run the game smoothly, I advise you to open python files with same names as my files in a coding enviroment (I use Pycharm).
Then copy the codes from here and paste it there.
Finally, run the "main.py" file and enjoy!
